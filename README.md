# Github Little Demo
> ABSTRACTION IS THE ART OF CODING

A small project with a deeper experimentation in `Dagger 2`, `MVP`, `RxJava` and `RxAndroid`, implementing the clean way i am seeing now in architecting. Inspired by the great [Dahaka](URL) example.

## Features

- `Dagger 2` : Working with Android Injector and Different Scopes, *UserScope*, *AuthScope*
- `A Small Clean Architecture` : Thats what i've called it, dividing project into two basic layers, **Data** layer and **Presentation** layer which include what we can say the **Domain** layer
